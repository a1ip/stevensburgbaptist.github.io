## Welcome to Stevensburg Baptist Church

Stevensburg Baptist Church is a Bible-based, mission-focused fellowship. We believe the Bible is Godâ€™s Word, that Christ died for our sins, and that believers are sanctified through the power of the Holy Spirit.

### It's time to start designing your car for the SBC Awana Gran Prix on 2/17/2018!

Not sure where to start? Join us for derby workshops on Sundays 4-5pm where you can purchase kits, design and build your car. We'll have all the tools you need! Then stay and have fun at Awanas from 5-6:30pm!
